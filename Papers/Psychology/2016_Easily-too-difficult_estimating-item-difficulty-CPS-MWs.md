# Abstract

* The importances of Complexity & Dynamics in life are increasing.
  * Complex systems has instigated the use of computer simulations (microworlds; MWs) to assess behavior in complex situation
  * But their psychometric qualities have been questioned
  * Only a few studies have investigated about **item difficulty** in MWs
* Our study: 3128 students with a linear logistic test model
  * We find six characteristics,
    * the use and number of eighen dynamics
    * the numbers of input variables
    * the numbers of output variables
    * the numbers of input variables not related to any other variables
    * the numbers of output variables not related to any other variables
    * the total number of relations between all variables
  * and they are almost perfectly predicted item difficulty
* +, The difficulty of controlling an MW (knowledge application) and understanding its underlying structure (knowledge acquisition) should be differentiated.
