* The (alternative) method of subtraction
  * Price & Friston, 1997 에서 처음 소개되었음.
  * The method ob subtraction tries to identify all processes that are unique to the primary task by subtracting out processes that are common to both tasks, but a conjunction analysis takes the opposite tack by seeking to **identify processes that are common to all tasks**.
* Problem with a conjunction analysis
  * common process 이지만 unrelated to the process of interest 도 나온다
    * (버튼을 누르는 것 등)
  * 해결책: difference maps 로 conjunction analysis 를 하면 됨 (Price & Friston, 1997)
* Criticism (Caplan & Moo, 2004)
  * For example, it provides no guidance on how to choose any of the tasks that are required, and if pure insertion is violated, then there is no guarantee that the network that survives the subtractions and conjunction is not contaminated by nuisance processes or that it accurately estimates the processes of interest.
