## Abstract

* Learning association (e.g., face-name)
  * Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are critical
* HPC - PFC interactions
  * rare in monkey studies (because of their cognitive/mnemonic abilities)
* We show **functional differences and frequency-specific interactions between HPC-PFC** of monkeys during associative learning
  * PFC spiking: reflected learning in parallel with behavioral performance
  * HPC spiking: reflected feedback (trial-and-error guesses were correct/incorect)
  * Theta-band HPC_PFC synchrony: was stronger after errors, decreased with learning
    * This was driven by PFC to HPC directional influences
  * Alpha/beta-band synchrony: was stronger after correct trial, increased with learning
    * This was driven more by HPC
  * PFC: rapid object associative learning (maybe)
  * HPC: guide neocortical plasticity by signaling succes/failure (maybe)
