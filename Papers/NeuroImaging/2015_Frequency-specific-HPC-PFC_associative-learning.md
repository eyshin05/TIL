## Abstract

* Learning association (e.g., face-name)
  * Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are critical
* HPC - PFC interactions
  * rare in monkey studies (because of their cognitive/mnemonic abilities)
* We show **functional differences and frequency-specific interactions between HPC-PFC** of monkeys during associative learning
  * PFC spiking: reflected learning in parallel with behavioral performance
  * HPC spiking: reflected feedback (trial-and-error guesses were correct/incorect)
  * Theta-band HPC_PFC synchrony: was stronger after errors, decreased with learning
    * This was driven by PFC to HPC directional influences
  * Alpha/beta-band synchrony: was stronger after correct trial, increased with learning
    * This was driven more by HPC
  * PFC: rapid object associative learning (maybe)
  * HPC: guide neocortical plasticity by signaling succes/failure (maybe)



## Introduction

* PFC-HPC interactions
  * in rodent: spatial memory
  * in primates: + declative memory
* HPC damage
  * causes deficits in non-spatial associative learning
* FPC damage
  * causes deficits non-spatial associative memories → implicit memory 감소
* Human imaging
  * HPC, FPC both activate during associative meory
* Rodents study
  * theta synchrony between PFC-HPC during spatial memory performance
  * high-frequency ripple sybchrony during subsequent sleep
    * HPC acquires spatial information
    * integrating it into cortical networks for long-term storage
* Primates study
  * non-spatial memories has not been tested
* Our study
  * in monkey
  * non-spatial associations are acquired by PFC
  * learning-related frequency-specific feedback to PFC are related to HPC
