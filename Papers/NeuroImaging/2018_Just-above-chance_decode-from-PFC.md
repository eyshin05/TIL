## Abstract

* The prefrontal cortex
  * Features: flexible, goal-directed cognition
  * About "understanding its representational code"
* Using MVPA to solve this problem
  * MVPA studies of PFC = mixed success
  * The base rate of decoding information from PFC (from a meta anlysis)
    * 55.4%
    * Visual = 66.6%, Temporal = 71.0%
