## Abstract

* Skill acquisition 은 인지적 제어에 덜 의지하게 되는 과정
* Skill automaticity: limited attentional resource 를 쓰지 않고 수행함 (전통적으로)
* Learning: plan, execution, updating 에 필요한 cognitive process 가 점점 효율적으로 되는 것



## Introduction

* Two general characteristics of motor skill acquisition
  * Performance improves.
  * Skill performance becomes automated.
* Contextual interference effect (Shea and Morgan, 1979)
  * A case where neural patterns of automaticity - early in learning to provide temporary performance gains (as opposed to long-term skill learning)

### 1.1 Developing views on skill automaticity

* Earlist consideration of autmoaticity (Aristotle)
  * Spontaneous 하게 되는 것
* Descarte's view
  * Continuum of controlled and automatic performance
  * In line with contemporary teories of motor skill learning (1967)
* Limited capacity 에서 skilled performance 를 하려면 automaticity 가 필요
* Feedforward control
  * Feedback control 의 반대 개념
  * Feedforward control, where production of skilled action does not rely on concurrent sensory input to guide the action, is possible when movement production is based on an internal model (Wolpert et al. [1998](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-34784-0_12#CR157); Kawato [1999](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-34784-0_12#CR73)), which has been described as involving a motor program (Schmidt [1975](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-34784-0_12#CR121), [2003](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-34784-0_12#CR122)) or motor chunk (Verwey [1999](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-34784-0_12#CR147)).

### 1.2 Extended practice requirements for skill automaticity

* Motor skill automaticity 에 관한 하나의 합의된 정의가 존재하지 않음
* Overtraining 이 필요

### 1.3 Cognitive characteristics of skill automaticity

* Dual-task methodology
* Skill automaticity might also be characterized by the degree of performance inflexibility that is observed following a period of training
  *  they will not be modifiable when new conditions are introduced 
  * Helie et al., 2010 의 2번째 실험
