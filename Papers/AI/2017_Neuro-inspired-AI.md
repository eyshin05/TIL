## Abstract

* Can understanding biological brains play a rold in building intelligent machines?
* 를 보여주는 review paper
* Conclusion: Highlighting shared themes may be key for both field



## Intro

* 예전에는 AI, neuroscience, psychology 와 다른 field 들이 밀접히 연관되어 있었음
  * 최근에는 the interaction has become less commonplace
  * But we argue that neuroscience is important in generating ideas for AI research
* Human level general AI is a hard task (ex., turing test)
  * Becuase **possible solutions have vast spaces and only very sparsely populated**.
  * So we should study human/animal brains - as existing proofs
* The benefits of studying AI & biological intelligence
  * Neuroscience can provide inspirations for *new types of algorithms and architectures* 
    * In AI, mathematical and logic-based methods have dominated...
